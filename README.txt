In this project our goal is to create a personal diary like it is presented in this page https://www.codewithc.com/mini-project-in-c-personal-diary-management-system/

We already did a C project in class but this one is something more personal because we do it by our own during the summer holidays so we do not have our teacher\'92s help. It is not only our first solo C project, it is also our first solo computer science project so it is important for us because we do not want to start on a failure.}
